a very crappy game i made as a final project in my first programming class (AP Computer Science) in high school

the game isnt very fun and pretty glitchy, but it is functional. the main point of the game was to show that I could apply some of the concepts i learned throughout the year to something. 

I utilized the Slick2d game framework to make the game http://slick.ninjacave.com

for a quick screenshot of the game:
